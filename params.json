It is designed to increase productivity and simplify your workflow.\r\n\r\n### How Does It Work? ###\r\nWhen ever you complete a todo, information about it is saved. The priority, keywords, and other aspects from each todo are used by the sorting algorithm to determine how to organize your todos.\r\n\r\n### What Is Next? ###\r\nFuture versions of todocmd will improve todo sorting and take aspects like time completed into consideration when organizing your todos. Additional improvements, such as a note functionality, are also planned.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
